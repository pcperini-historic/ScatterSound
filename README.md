#ScatterSound#


##Overview##

ScatterSound is an application designed to play an audio file at user-specified, pseudorandom intervals.

For example, when given the sound clip "Sosumi.aiff", the minimum interval 00:00:30, and the maximum interval 24:00:00, ScatterSound will play "Sosumi.aiff" at least once per day, but no more than once every 30 seconds.
