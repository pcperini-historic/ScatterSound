##Overview##

ScatterSound is an application designed to play an audio file at user-specified, pseudorandom intervals.

For example, when given the sound clip "Sosumi.aiff", the minimum interval 00:00:30, and the maximum interval 24:00:00, ScatterSound will play "Sosumi.aiff" at least once per day, but no more than once every 30 seconds.

This behavior is often desired to "stress-test" new sounds, offering a variance between sparsity and frequency. The driving factor behind the development of ScatterSound was to test a new alert sound to make sure that it was noticable but not irritating.

##Compiled App##
The Disk Image for the compiled ScatterSound.app file can be found [here](https://github.com/downloads/inspyretech/ScatterSound/ScatterSound.dmg).
The app supports 64-bit machines running OS X 10.7 or later, and may be compatible with OS X 10.5 - 10.6. The app is sandboxed, and signed with Inspyre Technologies [Developer ID](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html).
